# Mask R-CNN pipeline for detecting vessels on the VMD
This GitHub repository contains the pipeline for detecting and segmenting sand mining river vessels on the Vietnam Mekong Delta, using PlanetScope imagery and Mask R-CNN. The dimensions of these vessels were used to compose a sand budget for the Mekong river in the provinces of An Giang and Dong Thap, Vietnam.
